          <h1><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_(character)" target="_blank">HARRY POTTER </a></h1>
            
          <p>Harry James Potter is a fictional character and the titular protagonist in 
            J. K. Rowling's series of eponymous novels. The majority of the books' plot 
            covers seven years in the life of the orphan Harry, who, on his eleventh birthday, 
            learns he is a wizard. Thus, he attends Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry 
            to practise magic under the guidance of the kindly headmaster Albus Dumbledore and 
            other school professors along with his best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger.
            Harry also discovers that he is already famous throughout the novel's magical community,
            and that his fate is tied with that of Lord Voldemort – the internationally feared Dark
            Wizard and murderer of his parents, Lily and James. The book and film series revolve 
            around Harry's struggle to adapt to the wizarding world and defeat Voldemort.</p><br>

            <p>According to Rowling, Harry is strongly guided by his own conscience, and has a 
              keen feeling of what is right and wrong. Having "very limited access to truly 
              caring adults", Rowling said, Harry "is forced to make his own decisions from an 
              early age on." He "does make mistakes", she conceded, but in the end, he does 
              what his conscience tells him to do. According to Rowling, one of Harry's pivotal 
              scenes came in the fourth book when he protects his dead schoolmate Cedric 
              Diggory's body from Voldemort, because it shows he is brave and selfless.</p><br>

            <p>Rowling has stated that Harry's character flaws include anger and impulsiveness; 
              however, Harry is also innately honourable. "He's not a cruel boy. He's 
              competitive, and he's a fighter. He doesn't just lie down and take abuse. But he 
              does have native integrity, which makes him a hero to me. He's a normal boy but 
              with those qualities most of us really admire." For the most part, Harry shows 
              humility and modesty, often downplaying his achievements; though he uses a litany 
              of his adventures as examples of his maturity early in the fifth book. However, 
              these very same accomplishments are later employed to explain why he should lead 
              Dumbledore's Army, at which point he asserts them as having just been luck, and 
              denies that they make him worthy of authority. After the seventh book, Rowling 
              commented that Harry has the ultimate character strength, which not even Voldemort 
              possesses: the acceptance of the inevitability of death.

          <h1><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermione_Granger" target="_blank">HERMIONE JEAN GRANGER</a></h1>
          <p>Hermione Jean Granger is a fictional character in J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter series. 
            She first appears in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, as a new student on her 
            way to Hogwarts. After Harry and Ron save her from a mountain troll in the girls' 
            restroom, she becomes best friends with them and often uses her quick wit, deft recall, 
            and encyclopaedic knowledge to lend aid in dire situations. Rowling has stated that 
            Hermione resembles herself as a young girl, with her insecurity and fear of failure.</p>
            <br>
          <p>Hermione Jean Granger is a Muggle-born Gryffindor, who becomes best friends with 
            Harry Potter and Ron Weasley. J.K. Rowling states that she was born on 19 September 
            1979 and she was nearly twelve when she first attended Hogwarts. She is an overachiever 
            who excels academically and is described by J.K. Rowling as a "very logical, upright and 
            good" character. J.K. Rowling adds that Hermione's parents, two Muggle dentists, 
            are a bit bemused by their odd daughter but "very proud of her all the same. 
            "They are well aware of the wizarding world and have visited Diagon Alley with her. 
            Hermione was originally intended to have a sister, but the planned sibling did not make 
            an appearance in the first Harry Potter novel and, as Rowling noted, it "seemed too late" 
            to introduce the character after all of that. Rowling confirmed in a 2004 interview that 
            Hermione is an only child.</p> <br>

            <p>Hermione is extremely compassionate and is very quick to help others, especially 
              those who are defenceless, such as Neville Longbottom, first-years, House-Elves, 
              fellow Muggle-borns, half-giants like Hagrid, and werewolves like Lupin. It was 
              revealed by J.K. Rowling after the publication of the final book that Hermione's 
              career in the Ministry was to fight for the rights of the oppressed and 
              disenfranchised (such as House-elves or Muggle-borns). Hermione is also very 
              protective of her friends and values them so much that Rowling has suggested 
              that, if Hermione had looked in the Mirror of Erised, she would have seen Harry, 
              Ron, and herself "alive and unscathed, and Voldemort finished." Hermione has 
              also learned to ignore what bullies such as Draco Malfoy say to her, often 
              preventing Harry and Ron from retaliating and thinking of some way to outsmart 
              him. She accepts her status as a Muggle-born witch, and states in Deathly Hallows 
              that she is "a Mudblood and proud of it".</p>

          <h1> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Weasley" target="_blank">RONALD BILIUS WEASLEY</a></h1>
          <p>Ronald Bilius Weasley is a fictional character in J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter 
            fantasy novel series. His first appearance was in the first book of the series, 
            Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, as the best friend of Harry Potter and 
            Hermione Granger. He is a member of the Weasley family, a pure blood family that 
            resides in "The Burrow" outside Ottery St. Catchpole. Being the only member of the 
            three main characters raised in magical society, he also provides insight into the 
            Wizarding World's magical customs and traditions. Along with Harry and Hermione,
            he is a member of Gryffindor house and is present for most of the action throughout 
            the series.</p><br>

            <p>Ron is known for his humor, loyalty, readiness to defend his friends and his love 
              for sweets. Rowling in an interview described Ron as very funny but insensitive and 
              immature, saying "There's a lot of immaturity about Ron, and that's where a lot of 
              the humor comes from." As his first exercise with the actors who portray the 
              central trio, Alfonso Cuarón, who directed the third film in the series, Prisoner 
              of Azkaban, assigned them to write an autobiographical essay about their character, 
              written in the first person, spanning birth to the discovery of the magical world, 
              and including the character's emotional experience. Of Rupert Grint's essay, Cuarón 
              recalls, "Rupert didn't deliver the essay. When I questioned why he didn't do it, he 
              said, 'I'm Ron; Ron wouldn't do it.' So I said, 'Okay, you do understand your character.
              '" Commenting on Ron's character development in the final book, Rowling explained that 
              "Ron is the most immature of the three main characters, but in part seven he grows up. 
              He was never strong footed, people see him mostly as Harry's friend; his mother had 
              actually wanted a girl and in the last book he finally has to acknowledge his weaknesses. 
              But it's exactly that which makes Ron a man."</p>

          <h1> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginny_Weasley" target="_blank">GINNY WEASLEY</a></h1>
          <p>Ginevra Molly Weasley is a fictional character in J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter 
            novel series. Ginny is introduced in the first book Harry Potter and the 
            Philosopher's Stone, as the youngest sibling and only girl in the Weasley family. 
            She becomes Harry's main love interest and eventually marries him at the conclusion 
            of the series.</p> <br>

            <p>Ginny Weasley is a pureblood witch born on 11 August 1981, the seventh child and 
              only daughter of Arthur and Molly Weasley. She attended Hogwarts School of 
              Witchcraft and Wizardry, and was sorted into Gryffindor house, along with the 
              rest of her family. According to J.K. Rowling, "the backstory with Ginny was, 
              she was the first girl to arrive in the Weasley family in generations, but there's 
              that old tradition of the seventh daughter of a seventh daughter and a seventh son 
              of a seventh son, so that's why she's the seventh, because she is a gifted witch. 
              I think you get hints of that, because she does some pretty impressive stuff here 
              and there". Over the course of the series, Ginny becomes a strong witch who 
              shows herself to be independent and capable, fighting alongside Harry on more than 
              one occasion as he battles against the Dark Arts.</p> <br>

            <p>Ginny is forceful, independent and often speaks her mind. She has an energetic, 
              lively personality; having feelings for Harry, she became shy and withdrawn in his 
              presence, during the first few years of their friendship. According to Harry, 
              growing up with six older brothers toughened her up. Ginny is not afraid to 
              stand up to anybody, friends and enemies alike. Notably, she stands up to Draco 
              Malfoy on their first meeting in Flourish and Blotts when he insults Harry in 
              Chamber of Secrets. She even stands up to Hermione, her close friend, in defence 
              of Harry's use of the Sectumsempra curse. When describing Ginny, J.K. Rowling 
              notes she is "tough, not in an unpleasant way, but gutsy", also describing her 
              as "warm and compassionate". Ginny was very popular during her time at Hogwarts, 
              and drew attraction by numerous boys. Ron in particular felt that Ginny was "too 
              popular for her own good".</p>

          <h1> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draco_Malfoy" target="_blank">DRACO MALFOY</a></h1>
          <p>Draco Lucius Malfoy is a fictional character in J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter series. 
            He is a student in Harry Potter's year belonging in the Slytherin house. He is 
            frequently accompanied by his two cronies, Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle, who act as 
            henchmen. Draco is characterised as a cowardly bully who tricks and hurts people to get 
            what he wants; nevertheless, he is a cunning user of magic. He was played by Tom Felton 
            in the Harry Potter film series.</p> <br>

            <p>Draco is the prototypical spoiled, rich brat; he believes that his family's wealth 
              and social position gives him the right to bully those poorer than himself, such as 
              Ron Weasley. He also insults Hermione Granger's Muggle-born status by referring to 
              her as a "Mudblood", a term that, as stated by Hagrid, is one not used in civilised 
              conversations. As Rowling explained in 1999, "He's a bigot and he's a bully, and as 
              I say, in the most refined sense, he knows exactly what will hurt people".</p><br>

            <p>In a July 2005 interview, Rowling added that Draco, unlike Harry, never feels 
              remorse for his actions: "I thought of Draco as someone who is very capable of 
              compartmentalising his life and his emotions, and always has done. So he's shut 
              down his pity, enabling him to bully effectively. He's shut down compassion— how 
              else would you become a Death Eater?"</p> <br>
              
            <p>Draco, as well as Dudley Dursley, was indoctrinated with his parents' beliefs. 
              Rowling commented that "The moment Draco got what he thought he wanted, to become 
              a Death Eater, and given a mission by Lord Voldemort, as he did in Harry Potter 
              and the Half-Blood Prince, reality finally hit him" because his dream was "so very 
              different". Rowling also stated that there was a real moral cowardice in Draco, but 
              that he was not wholly bad.</p>

          <h1> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Voldemort" target="_blank">TOM RIDDLE</a></h1>
          <p>Lord Voldemort is a sobriquet for Tom Marvolo Riddle, a fictional character and the 
            main antagonist in J. K. Rowling's series of Harry Potter novels. Voldemort first 
            appeared in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, which was published in 1997. 
            Voldemort appears either in person or in flashbacks in each book and its film 
            adaptation in the series except the third, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, 
            in which he is only mentioned.</p> <br>

          <p>Voldemort is the archenemy of Harry Potter, who according to a prophecy has 
            "the power to vanquish the Dark Lord". He attempts to murder the boy, but instead 
            kills his parents, Lily and James Potter, and leaves Harry with a scar on his head 
            in the shape of a lightning bolt. Nearly every witch or wizard dares not utter his 
            name and refers to him instead with such monikers as "You-Know-Who", "He Who Must 
            Not Be Named", or "the Dark Lord". Voldemort's obsession with blood purity signifies 
            his aim to rid the wizarding world of Muggle (non-magical) heritage and to conquer 
            both worlds, Muggle and wizarding, to achieve pure-blood dominance. Through his 
            mother's family, he is the last descendant of the wizard Salazar Slytherin, one of 
            the four founders of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He is the leader of 
            the Death Eaters, a group of evil wizards and witches dedicated to ridding the 
            Wizarding World of Muggles and establishing Voldemort as its supreme ruler.</p><br>

            <p>In a 1999 interview, Rowling said Voldemort was invented as a nemesis for Harry 
              Potter, and she intentionally did not flesh out Voldemort's backstory at first. 
              "The basic idea was that Harry didn't know he was a wizard. And so then I 
              kind of worked backwards from that position to find out how that could be, that 
              he wouldn't know what he was. When he was one year old, the most evil wizard 
              for hundreds and hundreds of years attempted to kill him. He killed Harry's 
              parents, and then he tried to kill Harry—he tried to curse him. Harry has 
              to find out, before we find out. And—so—but for some mysterious reason the curse 
              didn't work on Harry. So he's left with this lightning bolt-shaped scar on his 
              forehead and the curse rebounded upon the evil wizard, who has been in hiding ever 
              since."</p>

          <h1> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minerva_McGonagall" target="_blank">PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL</a></h1>
          <p>Professor Minerva McGonagall is a fictional character in J. K. Rowling's Harry 
            Potter series. Professor McGonagall is a professor at Hogwarts School for Witchcraft 
            and Wizardry and is the head of Gryffindor House and professor of Transfiguration, 
            as well as being the Deputy Headmistress under Albus Dumbledore and a member of the 
            Order of the Phoenix. Following Lord Voldemort's defeat at the hands of her student 
            Harry Potter and the deaths of Headmasters Albus Dumbledore and Severus Snape, 
            McGonagall takes the position of Headmistress. Professor McGonagall was portrayed 
            in the film adaptations by Maggie Smith.</p> <br>

            <p>Minerva McGonagall was born on 4 October 1935 in Scotland to Robert McGonagall 
              and Isobel Ross. McGonagall was born a half-blood witch as her father was a Muggle 
              and her mother a witch. McGonagall began her Hogwarts education at the age of 
              eleven and was sorted into Gryffindor after being the longest ever Hatstall between 
              Gryffindor and Ravenclaw. McGonagall became friends with Hufflepuff student and 
              future colleague Pomona Sprout and gained a particular talent in the art of 
              Transfiguration under the tutelage of then Transfiguration professor Albus 
              Dumbledore. During this time, McGonagall managed to become an Animagus, taking the 
              form of a tabby cat and filed her paperwork to be officially registered. 
              McGonagall was also a skilled member of the Gryffindor Quidditch team. After 
              graduation, McGonagall became an employee for the Ministry of Magic in the 
              Department of Magical Law Enforcement where she met her husband, Elphinstone 
              Urquart. McGonagall was offered a promotion but turned it down and applied to 
              teach Transfiguration at Hogwarts under Dumbledore. During her employment at 
              Hogwarts, McGonagall grew particularly close to Dumbledore and the two were near 
              inseparable friends and colleagues, and he began to recognise her as one of his 
              most trusted allies. Eventually, McGonagall became the Head of the Transfiguration 
              Department as well as the Head of Gryffindor House. After Headmaster Armando 
              Dippet's retirement and Dumbledore's appointment as Headmaster, McGonagall became 
              his Deputy Headmistress. Despite being a crucial force during the First Wizarding 
              War against Lord Voldemort, McGonagall was not a member of the initial forming of 
              the Order of the Phoenix. During the war, McGonagall lost her brother, Robert Jr, 
              and two of her favourite students, James and Lily Potter.</p>

          <h1> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" target="_blank">PROFESSOR ALBUS DUMBLEDORE</a></h1>
          <p>Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore is a fictional character in J. K. 
            Rowling's Harry Potter series. For most of the series, he is the headmaster of the 
            wizarding school Hogwarts. As part of his backstory, it is revealed that he is the 
            founder and leader of the Order of the Phoenix, an organisation dedicated to 
            fighting Lord Voldemort, the main antagonist of the series.</p><br>

          <p>Rowling stated she chose the name Dumbledore, which is a dialectal word for 
            "bumblebee", because of Dumbledore's love of music: she imagined him walking 
            around "humming to himself a lot".</p> <br>

          <p>Considered the most powerful wizard in the world, Dumbledore is benevolent and wise, 
            a good wizard in the style of Merlin.[citation needed] He exudes an aura of serenity 
            and composure, rarely displaying intense emotions of anger or fear. Yet despite his 
            benign nature, it is said that Dumbledore is the only wizard Lord Voldemort ever truly 
            feared. Dumbledore is very eccentric and even slightly effeminate; he is very fond of 
            knitting patterns and frequently wears flamboyant clothing (at one point, he is seen 
            wearing a flowered bonnet). He is also known for his odd displays of whimsicality; he 
            often uses humour to make people feel comfortable in his presence. As a supremely 
            talented wizard, Dumbledore displays numerous examples of extraordinary powers. 
            His abilities as a wizard are combined with a kind of cunning and subtlety of mind that 
            allowed him to comprehend human nature and turn the better aspects of humanity (trust, 
            love, and friendship) to Voldemort's disadvantage in particular.</p> <br>
          
          <p>More than anything else, Dumbledore has a deep capacity for love, frequently 
            reminding Harry that love was the greatest magic of all. Dumbledore believes in the 
            good in everyone and insists on giving second chances. The greatest example of this 
            is Dumbledore's relationship with Snape, in whom Dumbledore is willing to place a 
            considerable amount of faith because he showed remorse. Dumbledore is highly perceptive 
            and emotionally intelligent; his knowledge of a person's true personality goes beyond 
            simply being a good judge of character. This is never more apparent than in his complex 
            insights into Voldemort's psyche, which he pieces together with Harry to deduce where 
            Voldemort's horcruxes are hidden.</p>

          <h1> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severus_Snape" target="_blank">PROFESSOR SNAPE</a></h1>
          <p>Severus Snape is a fictional character in J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter series. 
            He is an exceptionally skilled wizard whose sarcastic, controlled exterior conceals 
            deep emotions and anguish. A Professor at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, 
            Snape is hostile to Harry due to his resemblance to his father James Potter. According 
            to the series, James bullied Snape during their time together at Hogwarts.</p> <br>

            <p>As the series progresses, Snape's character becomes more layered and enigmatic. A 
              central mystery is unravelled concerning his loyalties. Snape dies at the hands of 
              Lord Voldemort in the seventh book, at which time his back story is revealed. Despite 
              his attraction to the Dark Arts and Voldemort's ideology of wizard supremacy, Snape's 
              love for Muggle-born Lily Evans, Harry's mother, eventually compelled him to defect 
              from the Death Eaters. He then became a double agent for Albus Dumbledore and the Order 
              of the Phoenix. The fact that Lily chose James Potter, Harry's father, only fuels Snape's 
              hostility towards Harry.</p> <br>

            <p>Snape is generally depicted as being cold, calculating, precise, sarcastic, and 
              bitter. He strongly dislikes Harry and often insults him by insulting his father 
              James. As the series progresses, it is revealed that his treatment of Harry stems 
              from Snape's bitter rivalry with James when they were in school together. In 
              particular, James and Sirius bullied Snape, which according to Alan Rickman caused 
              the already lonely boy to further "shut himself in". Rowling further described 
              the young Snape as insecure and vulnerable: "Given his time over again Snape 
              would not have become a Death Eater, but like many insecure, vulnerable people he 
              craved membership of something big and powerful, something impressive. He was so 
              blinded by his attraction to the dark side he thought Lily would find him 
              impressive if he became a real Death Eater."</p>

          <h1><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubeus_Hagrid" target="_blank">RUBEUS HAGRID</a></h1>
          <p>Rubeus Hagrid is a fictional character in the Harry Potter book series written by 
            J. K. Rowling. He is introduced in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone as a 
            half-giant and half-human who is the gamekeeper and Keeper of Keys and Grounds of 
            Hogwarts, the primary setting for the first six novels. In the third novel Harry 
            Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Hagrid is promoted to Care of Magical Creatures 
            professor, and is later revealed to be a member of the Order of the Phoenix. 
            A loyal, friendly, softhearted personality who is easily brought to tears, he is 
            also known for his thick West Country accent.</p> <br>

            <p>He has a friendly, softhearted personality and is easily driven to tears, as seen 
              in his very first scene, when he drops Harry off at the Dursleys' in Philosopher’s 
              Stone. He is very loyal to his peers, especially Dumbledore, to whom he refers as 
              the greatest wizard in the world multiple times. As first seen in Philosopher’s 
              Stone, he becomes extremely angry whenever anyone insults Dumbledore around him 
              (a mistake made by Vernon Dursley, who called Dumbledore a "crackpot old fool"). 
              He is also very loyal to Harry, suffered several times during the series because 
              of this loyalty, and had to go into hiding twice to avoid prison. Rowling says of 
              Hagrid, "Hagrid was always supposed to be this almost elemental force. He’s like 
              the king of the forest, or the Green Man. He’s this semi-wild person who lives on 
              the edge of the forest".</p> <br>

              <p>Following his expulsion from Hogwarts, the Ministry of Magic broke Hagrid’s 
                oak wand and forbade him to perform magic. Hagrid keeps the pieces of his 
                wand in a pink umbrella, and performs small spells from time to time; however, 
                he was technically forbidden to do magic until the third book, and since he is 
                not a fully qualified wizard, he "will always be a bit inept" as compared to 
                other adult wizards, but "occasionally surprises everyone, himself included, 
                by bringing off more impressive bits of magic". However, he is unable to 
                produce a Patronus. He also has magical abilities that stem from his giant 
                blood. For example, in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, many of the 
                stunning spells thrown at him by Ministry officials simply bounce off him. Also, 
                being half-giant gives Hagrid some level of superhuman strength, which allowed 
                him to bend the barrel of a shotgun with one hand.</p>
